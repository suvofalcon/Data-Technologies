# Match Clause in neo4j

## Matching all nodes in the database
```
match (n)
return n
```
## Matching Group of Related Nodes
We use labels for the same. We return all nodes for a particular label as below
```
match (p:Person)
return p

// match directly by property
match (n{title:"The Da Vinci Code"})
return n

// you can set a label for the same
match (n{title:"The Da Vinci Code"})
set n:Action
return n

// you can now return from two labels going deeper
match (n:Movie:Action)
return n
```
## Matching Related Nodes
If We want to return related nodes - match all nodes which have some relationship with any of the nodes
```
// this will NOT return any of the nodes which are existing in the database
// in silos - without any relationship
match (n)--(m)
return *
```
### EX01 - Return any nodes which is connected to actor 'Tom Hanks'
```
match (a{name:"Tom Hanks"})--(r)
return *

// if we only want to see the relationship and not Tom Hanks
match (a{name:"Tom Hanks"})--(r)
return r
```
## Matching With Labels
Return all movie nodes connected to Robert Zemeckis
```
match (a{name:"Robert Zemeckis"})--(m:Movie)
return *
```
## Matching by Incoming Relationships
Return all nodes connected to 'The Polar Express' by incoming relationships
```
match (m{title:"The Polar Express"})<--(n)
return *
```
## Using Uncommon Characters as Variable Names
```
match (`return all nodes`)
return `return all nodes`
```
## Copying Properties from Nodes
Let us say there is a node A which has a property city:'NewYork'
We want to create another node B and copy this same property from A to B
```
match (a{name:'A'})
create (b{name:'B', city:a.city})
return b.city
```
## Copying Properties from Relationships
Let us Say A 'KNOWS' B 'Since 2016'
I want to create another relationship from B to C with same properties
```
// First Create the necessary nodes and relationship
create 
(a:Person{name:'A'}),
(b:Person{name:'B'}),
(c:Person{name:'C'}),
(a)-[r1:KNOWS{since:'2016'}]->(b)
return *

// The do the copy
match (a{name:'A'})-[rel]->(b{name:'B'})
match (c{name:'C'})
create (b)<-[r2:KNOWS{since:rel.since}]-(c{name:'C'})
return properties (r2)
```

# Match Clause in neo4j

## Matching all nodes in the database
```
match (n)
return n
```
## Matching Group of Related Nodes
We use labels for the same. We return all nodes for a particular label as below
```
match (p:Person)
return p

// match directly by property
match (n{title:"The Da Vinci Code"})
return n

// you can set a label for the same
match (n{title:"The Da Vinci Code"})
set n:Action
return n

// you can now return from two labels going deeper
match (n:Movie:Action)
return n
```
## Matching Related Nodes
If We want to return related nodes - match all nodes which have some relationship with any of the nodes
```
// this will NOT return any of the nodes which are existing in the database
// in silos - without any relationship
match (n)--(m)
return *
```
### EX01 - Return any nodes which is connected to actor 'Tom Hanks'
```
match (a{name:"Tom Hanks"})--(r)
return *

// if we only want to see the relationship and not Tom Hanks
match (a{name:"Tom Hanks"})--(r)
return r
```
## Matching With Labels
Return all movie nodes connected to Robert Zemeckis
```
match (a{name:"Robert Zemeckis"})--(m:Movie)
return *
```
## Matching by Incoming Relationships

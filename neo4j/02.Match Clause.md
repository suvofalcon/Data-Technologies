# Match Clause in neo4j

## Matching all nodes in the database
```
match (n)
return n
```
## Matching Group of Related Nodes
We use labels for the same. We return all nodes for a particular label as below
```
match (p:Person)
return p

// match directly by property
match (n{title:"The Da Vinci Code"})
return n

// you can set a label for the same
match (n{title:"The Da Vinci Code"})
set n:Action
return n

// you can now return from two labels going deeper
match (n:Movie:Action)
return n
```
## Matching Related Nodes
If We want to return related nodes - match all nodes which have some relationship with any of the nodes
```
// this will NOT return any of the nodes which are existing in the database
// in silos - without any relationship
match (n)--(m)
return *
```
### EX01 - Return any nodes which is connected to actor 'Tom Hanks'
```
match (a{name:"Tom Hanks"})--(r)
return *

// if we only want to see the relationship and not Tom Hanks
match (a{name:"Tom Hanks"})--(r)
return r
```
## Matching With Labels
Return all movie nodes connected to Robert Zemeckis
```
match (a{name:"Robert Zemeckis"})--(m:Movie)
return *
```
## Matching by Incoming Relationships
Return all nodes connected to 'The Polar Express' by incoming relationships
```
match (m{title:"The Polar Express"})<--(n)
return *
```
## Using Uncommon Characters as Variable Names
```
match (`return all nodes`)
return `return all nodes`
```
## Copying Properties from Nodes
Let us say there is a node A which has a property city:'NewYork'
We want to create another node B and copy this same property from A to B
```
match (a{name:'A'})
create (b{name:'B', city:a.city})
return b.city
```
## Copying Properties from Relationships
Let us Say A 'KNOWS' B 'Since 2016'
I want to create another relationship from B to C with same properties
```
// First Create the necessary nodes and relationship
create 
(a:Person{name:'A'}),
(b:Person{name:'B'}),
(c:Person{name:'C'}),
(a)-[r1:KNOWS{since:'2016'}]->(b)
return *

// The do the copy
match (a{name:'A'})-[rel]->(b{name:'B'})
match (c{name:'C'})
create (b)<-[r2:KNOWS{since:rel.since}]-(c{name:'C'})
return properties (r2)
```

## Fetching Relationship Types
Return the types of all relationships between 'Tom Hanks' and every other related node

```
match (t{name:'Tom Hanks'})-[r]-(n:Movie)
return type(r)
```
if we want to show count of relationships with any node the query can be modified as 
```
match (t{name:'Tom Hanks'})-[r]-(n)
return count(type(r))
```

## Matching on Relationship Types

Paul follows more than 20 people on the social media platform. Who are those people ?
```
match(k{name:'Paul Blythe'})-[r:FOLLOWS]->(n)
return n.name
```
## Matching with Multiple Relationship Types
Find all movies where Charlize Theron either acted, directed or produced
```
match(n{name:'Charlize Theron'})-[r:ACTED_IN|DIRECTED|PRODUCED]-(k)
return k.title
```
One Extra query
```
match(n)-[r:ACTED_IN|DIRECTED|PRODUCED]-(k)
return n.name, type(r), k.title
```

## Match and create
Create a relationship between Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks with colleague_of
```
match (z{name:"Robert Zemeckis"}), (t{name:"Tom Hanks"})
create (z)-[r1:colleague_of]->(t)[r2:colleague_of]->(z)
return *
```

## Using Multiple Relationships - I
Who are those who directed the movies where Tom Hanks acted in?
```
match (t{name:"Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d)
return d.name
```
## Using Multiple Relationships - II
Who are the other actors who acted with Tom Hanks in any movie?
```
match (t{name:"Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(n)
return n.name
```
Name of the movies where Tom Hanks Acted in
```
match (t{name:"Tom Hanks"})-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
return DISTINCT m.title
```
## Using Multiple Relationships - III
What are the names of the actors and titles of the movies , Robert Zemeckis directed?
```
match (r{name:"Robert Zemeckis"})-[:DIRECTED]->(m)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(p)
return p.name, m.title
```
## Optional Match
An OPTIONAL MATCH matches patterns against your graph database, just like a MATCH does. The difference is that if no matches are found, OPTIONAL MATCH will use a null for missing parts of the pattern. OPTIONAL MATCH could be considered the Cypher equivalent of the outer join in SQL.
```
match (m{title:"Cloud Atlas"})
optional match (m)-[r]->(n)  // When you are not sure whether an outward relationship exists from (m), we use optional match .. if it doesnt exist, the query will proceed considering it to be null
return m.title, n.name
```
Do not use optional match to match multiple nodes or patterns at the same time - because if any one doesnt exist, optional match will return null for everything, even if the other exists\
```
optional match(m{title:'Cloud Atlas'}),(n{name:"Neo4j"})
return *
```
```
optional match(m{title:'Cloud Atlas'}),(n{name:"Neo4j"}) // will return null for everything even if Cloud Atlas exists
optional match(t{name:"Tom Hanks"}) // this will return valid since the node exists
return *
```
